# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to enhance a travel application for
users by gathering weather data from over 600 cities worldwide. We
then gathered user preferences of weather temperatures and narrowed 
down their cities search and hotels options in a markered google map 
that displays only the cities within their weather preferences (as shown 
in the Vacation_Search file). Finally we created a Vacation Itinerary
that shows users travel routes of the cities of their choosing as well
as a markered map displaying the hotel name, city, Country, weather
discription, and maximum temperatures of their chosen cities.
